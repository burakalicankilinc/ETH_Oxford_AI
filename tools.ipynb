      "### 1. **Executive Summary**\n",
      "\n",
      "**Recommendation:** **Hold/Wait**\n",
      "\n",
      "- Short-term algorithmic indicators (ML/Prophet model) predict a systematic decrease in Amazon’s stock price over the next 30 days. \n",
      "- Brownian Motion models suggest a flat to slightly positive median projection but with wide risk (high volatility and broad confidence intervals).\n",
      "- The market’s macro sentiment is bullish, driven by strong fundamentals (AWS, AI investments), but this optimism is offset by technical weakness in the price forecasts.\n",
      "- Immediate entry is **not recommended**. Consider accumulating only if price action stabilizes or improves, particularly after the predicted drawdown or upon positive earnings surprises.\n",
      "\n",
      "---\n",
      "\n",
      "### 2. **Methodology & Technical Deep-Dive (CRITICAL SECTION)**\n",
      "\n",
      "#### **A. Brownian Motion (Monte Carlo Simulation)**\n",
      "- **What is it?**\n",
      "  - The Brownian model uses past price movements (random walk with drift and volatility) to simulate many possible future price paths.\n",
      "  - **Parameters:**\n",
      "    - **Annualized Volatility (σ): 31.53%**\n",
      "      - This measures typical price fluctuation. A 31.53% volatility means the price would be expected to swing ±31.53% in a year (from the mean trend), annualized from daily returns.\n",
      "    - **Annualized Drift (μ): 15.52%**\n",
      "      - This is the average “trend” — a positive drift of 15.52% implies a modestly bullish expected return, if the past trend persists.\n",
      "    - **Sample Size:** 502 historical daily data points (≈2 years).\n",
      "    - **Simulations:** 1,000 Monte Carlo runs to generate a probability distribution of outcomes.\n",
      "    - **Output:** Median forecast and 90% Confidence Interval (CI) for each target date.\n",
      "  - **How to read this?**\n",
      "    - High σ increases both upside and downside risk; μ shows a gentle upward trend. If the lower bound of the CI approaches or falls below recent trading ranges, downside risk is increasing.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### **B. Machine Learning Model (Prophet)**\n",
      "- **What is it?**\n",
      "  - A time-series model (Facebook Prophet) trained on daily stock prices (size of training data: 502 days).\n",
      "  - Fits past trends and seasonality to extrapolate future prices, including systematic patterns (e.g., post-earnings drift).\n",
      "  - **Output:** Point estimate with daily 80–95% confidence intervals (CI) for each date.\n",
      "  - In this case, the model forecasts a **steady, monotonic decline** in the stock over the next month, with both target and CI steadily shifting downward.\n",
      "- **Logic:**\n",
      "  - Unlike Brownian, the ML model interprets recent sharp moves (post-earnings fade, technical selloff, etc.) as likely to continue until reversal signals appear in data.\n",
      "  - CONSENSUS: Both median and lower/upper CIs predict a gradual erosion in price with few reversals detected.\n",

      "  - While technical tools flag **near-term downside risk** and uncertainty, the **fundamental story is strong**, with bullish sentiment and structural growth drivers.\n",
      "  - **Action for investors:** Consider waiting for short-term volatility and forecasted drawdown to subside before accumulating shares. Upside remains over a multiquarter horizon, but the 30-day tactical risk/reward does not favor immediate buying.\n",
